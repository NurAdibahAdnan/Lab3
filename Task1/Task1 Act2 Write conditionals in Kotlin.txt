2. Use if/else statements to express conditions

#Try it activity 1:

fun main() {
    println(1 < 1)
}

symbols and its output:
a) > = false
b) < = false
c) <= = true
d) >= = true
e) != = false

#Try it activity 2:

fun main() {
    val trafficLightColor = "Black"

    if (trafficLightColor == "Red") {
        println("Stop")
    } else if (trafficLightColor == "Yellow") {
        println("Slow")
    } else if (trafficLightColor == "Green") {
        println("Go")
    } else {
        println("Invalid traffic-light color")
    }

}

output : Invalid traffic-light color

3. Use a when statement for multiple branches

#Rewrite an if/else statement with a when statement:

fun main() {
    val trafficLightColor = "Yellow"

    when (trafficLightColor) {
        "Red" -> println("Stop")
        "Yellow" -> println("Slow")
        "Green" -> println("Go")
        else -> println("Invalid traffic-light color")
    }
}

output: Slow

#Write more complex conditions in a when statement

fun main() {
    val x = 3

    when (x) {
        2 -> println("x is a prime number between 1 and 10.")
        3 -> println("x is a prime number between 1 and 10.")
        5 -> println("x is a prime number between 1 and 10.")
        7 -> println("x is a prime number between 1 and 10.")
        else -> println("x isn't a prime number between 1 and 10.")
    }
}

output: x is a prime number between 1 and 10.

#Use a comma (,) for multiple conditions

fun main() {
    val x = 3

    when (x) {
        2, 3, 5, 7 -> println("x is a prime number between 1 and 10.")
        else -> println("x isn't a prime number between 1 and 10.")
    }
}

output: x is a prime number between 1 and 10.

#Use the in keyword for a range of conditions

fun main() {
    val x = 4

    when (x) {
        2, 3, 5, 7 -> println("x is a prime number between 1 and 10.")
        in 1..10 -> println("x is a number between 1 and 10, but not a prime number.")
        else -> println("x isn't a prime number between 1 and 10.")
    }
}

output: x is a number between 1 and 10, but not a prime number.

#Use the is keyword to check data type

fun main() {
    val x: Any = 20

    when (x) {
        2, 3, 5, 7 -> println("x is a prime number between 1 and 10.")
        in 1..10 -> println("x is a number between 1 and 10, but not a prime number.")
        is Int -> println("x is an integer number, but not between 1 and 10.")
        else -> println("x isn't an integer number.")
    }
}

output: x is an integer number, but not between 1 and 10.

#Try it exercise 1:

fun main() {
    val trafficLightColor = "Amber"

    when (trafficLightColor) {
        "Red" -> println("Stop")
        "Yellow", "Amber" -> println("Slow")
        "Green" -> println("Go")
        else -> println("Invalid traffic-light color")
    }
}

output: Slow

4.Use if/else and when as expression

#Convert an if statement to an expression

fun main() {
    val trafficLightColor = "Black"

    val message = 
      if (trafficLightColor == "Red") "Stop"
      else if (trafficLightColor == "Yellow") "Slow"
      else if (trafficLightColor == "Green") "Go"
      else "Invalid traffic-light color"

    println(message)
}

output: Invalid traffic-light color

#Try it exercise 1:

fun main() {
    val trafficLightColor = "Amber"

    val message = when(trafficLightColor) {
        "Red" -> "Stop"
        "Yellow", "Amber" -> "Slow"
        "Green" -> "Go"
        else -> "Invalid traffic-light color"
    }
    println(message)
}

output: Slow
