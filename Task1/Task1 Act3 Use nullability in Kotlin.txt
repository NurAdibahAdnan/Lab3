2. Use nullable variables

#what is null?

fun main() {
    val favoriteActor = null
    println(favoriteActor)
}

output: null

#Variable reassignments with null

fun main() {
    var favoriteActor: String? = "Sandra Oh"
    println(favoriteActor)

    favoriteActor = null
    println(favoriteActor)
}

output: Sandra Oh
        null

#Try it exercise 1:

Now that you can use the nullable String? type, can you initialize a variable with an Int value and reassign it to null?

fun main() {
    var number: Int? = 10
    println(number)
    
    number = null
    println(number)
}

output: 10
        null

3.Handle nullable variables

fun main() {
    var favoriteActor: String = "Sandra Oh"
    println(favoriteActor.length)
}

output: 9

#Access a property of a nullable variable

fun main() {
    var favoriteActor: String? = "Sandra Oh"
    println(favoriteActor.length)
}

output: Only safe (?.) or non-null asserted (!!.) 
        calls are allowed on a nullable receiver of type String?

#Use the ?. safe-call operator

fun main() {
    var favoriteActor: String? = null
    println(favoriteActor?.length)
}

output: null

#Use the !! not-null assertion operator

fun main() {
    var favoriteActor: String? = null
    println(favoriteActor!!.length)
}

output: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
 at FileKt.main (File.kt:3) 
 at FileKt.main (File.kt:-1) 
 at jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0 (:-2) 

#Use the if/else conditionals

fun main() {
    var favoriteActor: String? = null

    if(favoriteActor != null) {
      println("The number of characters in your favorite actor's name is ${favoriteActor.length}.")
    } else {
      println("You didn't input a name.")
    }
}

output: You didn't input a name.

fun main() {
    var favoriteActor: String? = "Sandra Oh"

    val lengthOfName = if (favoriteActor != null) {
      favoriteActor.length
    } else {
      0
    }

    println("The number of characters in your favorite actor's name is $lengthOfName.")
}

output: The number of characters in your favorite actor's name is 9.

#Use the ?: Elvis operator

fun main() {
    var favoriteActor: String? = "Sandra Oh"

    val lengthOfName = favoriteActor?.length ?: 0

    println("The number of characters in your favorite actor's name is $lengthOfName.")
}

output: The number of characters in your favorite actor's name is 9.
